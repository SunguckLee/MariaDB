In order to have RPMs of MySQL which are distributed via ULN for Oracle Linux
to be as closely compatible to such RPMs built and distributed by RedHat,
this directory contains additional files which originated at RedHat
and are used only for such RPMs intended for distribution via ULN.

Especially, this directory contains the spec file used to build these RPMs,
named "mysql.spec".  Please regard the following note:

    You are receiving a copy of the Red Hat spec file.
    The terms of the Oracle license do NOT apply to the Red Hat spec file;
    it is licensed under the
          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991
    separately from the Oracle programs you receive.
