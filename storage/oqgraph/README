OQGraph storage engine v3
Copyright (C) 2007-2013 Arjen G Lentz & Antony T Curtis for Open Query

The Open Query GRAPH engine (OQGRAPH) is a computation engine allowing
hierarchies and more complex graph structures to be handled in a
relational fashion. In a nutshell, tree structures and
friend-of-a-friend style searches can now be done using standard SQL
syntax, and results joined onto other tables.

Based on a concept by Arjen Lentz
v3 implementation by Antony Curtis, Arjen Lentz, Andrew McDonnell
